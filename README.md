# Loppis

The app is a simple experiment with ember, trying to aid people selling stuff co-op style. 

* All sold items have a seller id and a price.
* People pick what they want and the cashier use the app to register all items, 
making it easy to see how much each customer needs to pay and check history.
* At the end of the day, each seller can see how much was sold and tick when they get paid
